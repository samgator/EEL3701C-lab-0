# EEL3701C-lab-0

After joining the GitHub Classroom and associating the identifier with my GitHub account, I was met with an error message stating "Repository Access Issue: You no longer have access to your assignment repository. Contact your teacher for support."

Additionally, trying to access the classroom via https://github.com/EEL3701C/lab-0-samgator returned the error message "This invitation is invalid."
